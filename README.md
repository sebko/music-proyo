### Optional Command-Line Tools

```bash
# Analyze library API match potential
python3 library_match_scanner.py
```

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

### API Setup (Optional)
Add API credentials to `api_config.json`:
```json
{
  "lastfm_api_key": "your_lastfm_key",
  "discogs_token": "your_discogs_token"
}
```

### System Configuration
Modify `tagger_config.json`:
```json
{
  "confidence_threshold": 95.0,
  "backup_enabled": true,
  "auto_update_high_confidence": false,
  "max_genres_per_album": 5
}
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Features Implemented

### Genre Standardization
- **91 standardized genres** with hierarchical relationships
- **Intelligent mapping** of variations (e.g., "Hip-Hop" â†’ "Hip Hop")
- **Format validation** and consistency checking

### Smart Assignment (99.3% Coverage)
- **Artist analysis**: Genre suggestions based on artist's discography patterns
- **Directory parsing**: Extract hints from folder names and file paths  
- **Era-based suggestions**: Contextual genres based on release years
- **Multi-source confidence scoring**

### Production Safety
- **Automatic backups** before any file modifications
- **95% confidence threshold** for automatic updates
- **Manual review queue** for medium-confidence matches
- **Comprehensive logging** and rollback capabilities

### Quality Control
- **Duplicate detection** using similarity algorithms
- **Metadata validation** for completeness and consistency
- **Artist discography analysis** for genre consistency
- **Quality scoring** system (0-100)

## ðŸŽµ Genre Format

**Multi-genre with semicolon delimiter**: `"Metal; Black Metal; Atmospheric Black Metal"`
- Flat hierarchy (all genres at same level)
- Supports hierarchical searching (searching "Metal" finds "Black Metal" albums)
- Compatible with all major music players

## ðŸ“‹ Processing Pipeline

1. **Library Scan** - Direct filesystem analysis (no XML dependency)
2. **Smart Suggestions** - Multi-source genre recommendations  
3. **API Enhancement** - MusicBrainz/Last.fm/Discogs integration
4. **Confidence Scoring** - Intelligent automation decisions
5. **Safe Updates** - Backup â†’ Update â†’ Verify workflow
6. **Quality Validation** - Post-processing consistency checks

## ðŸš€ Ready for Production

The system is now **production-ready** with:
- âœ… **561 albums** ready for automatic genre assignment
- âœ… **156 albums** identified for genre improvement
- âœ… **95% confidence threshold** ensures accuracy
- âœ… **Comprehensive backup system** for safety
- âœ… **Manual review workflow** for edge cases
- âœ… **Web interface** for easy management

## ðŸ”„ Recommended Workflow

1. **Start the web interface**: `python3 music_dashboard.py`
2. **Access dashboard**: Open `http://localhost:5002` in your browser
3. **Run library analysis**: Use the web interface to analyze your library
4. **Test with dry run**: Start batch processing with dry-run mode
5. **Process high-confidence matches**: Run batch processing with 95% confidence threshold
