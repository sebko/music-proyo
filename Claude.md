# Music Library Genre Tagger - Enterprise Management System

**Goal**: Categorize 2,144+ albums with accurate, multi-genre tags using professional-grade music metadata management and comprehensive quality control.

## üöÄ PRIMARY ENTRY POINT

**Main Entry Point**: `music_dashboard.py` (Web-Based Management Interface)

This is the **SINGLE PRIMARY ENTRY POINT** that provides:
1. **Complete web-based management** of your music library
2. **Interactive batch processing** with real-time monitoring  
3. **Manual review interface** for uncertain matches
4. **Library analysis and statistics** dashboard
5. **All processing capabilities** through an intuitive web interface

### Quick Start:
```bash
# PRIMARY ENTRY POINT - Web-based music library management
python3 music_dashboard.py

# Access the interface at: http://localhost:5002
```

The system uses a **web-first architecture** where all functionality is accessed through the intuitive dashboard interface. The `batch_processor.py` module handles internal processing and is called automatically by the web interface - it should not be used directly.

## System Overview

This is a **sophisticated, enterprise-grade music library management system** designed to automatically analyze and categorize music collections with accurate, standardized genre tags. The system goes far beyond basic genre tagging to provide a complete solution for music metadata management, quality control, and library organization.

**Core Process**: Scans music library ‚Üí Fetches genre data from multiple APIs ‚Üí Intelligently assigns standardized genres ‚Üí Safely updates file tags

### Simplified Architecture 

The system follows **web-first architecture** with a single user entry point:

1. **Web Interface**: `music_dashboard.py` - **PRIMARY ENTRY POINT** - Complete web-based management interface
2. **Internal Processing**: `batch_processor.py` - **INTERNAL USE ONLY** - Called automatically by web interface

The web interface provides all functionality through an intuitive dashboard, while batch processing happens internally.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULE

**ALWAYS RESTART THE WEB SERVER AFTER ANY CHANGES**
- Template changes (*.html files)
- Python code changes (*.py files)  
- Configuration changes
- ANY modification to the system

**Required Steps:**
1. Kill existing web server process
2. Restart with `python3 music_dashboard.py`
3. Test the changes work

**NO EXCEPTIONS** - The web server MUST be restarted after every change.

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Multi-Source API Integration

The system queries multiple music databases with intelligent weighting:

- **Spotify**: Primary source with professional curation (weight: 1.0)
- **MusicBrainz**: Community-driven with high quality (weight: 0.85)
- **Discogs**: Detailed styles and rare releases (weight: 0.8)
- **Deezer**: European coverage (weight: 0.75)
- **Last.fm**: Community tags (weight: 0.7)

### Confidence Thresholds & Processing Logic

- **‚â•95%**: Automatic updates (high confidence)
- **80-94%**: Manual review queue (medium confidence)
- **<80%**: Requires manual intervention (low confidence)

### Genre Format & Standardization

- **Multi-genre format**: "Rock; Alternative; Indie Rock"
- **Hierarchical expansion**: "Death Metal" ‚Üí automatically includes "Metal"
- **Standardization examples**: "Hip-Hop" ‚Üí "Hip Hop", "R&B" ‚Üí "Rhythm and Blues"
- **200+ mapping rules** covering common variations and aliases

### Enterprise Safety Features

- **File modification safety** - Scanning operations (`music_dashboard.py`, `album_matcher.py`) NEVER modify source audio files - only read metadata. File modification is exclusively for tagging operations in separate modules (`tag_writer.py`)
- **Dry run mode** for all operations (test without changes)
- **Comprehensive validation** with detailed error checking
- **Safe tag writing** with file integrity verification
- **Rate limiting** respecting API quotas (50/min MusicBrainz, 300/min Last.fm)
