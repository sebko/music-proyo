# Music Library Genre Tagger - Enterprise Management System

**Goal**: Categorize 2,144+ albums with accurate, multi-genre tags using professional-grade music metadata management and comprehensive quality control.

## üöÄ PRIMARY ENTRY POINT

**Main Entry Point**: `batch_processor.py` (Consolidated CLI + Processing)

This is the **SINGLE PRIMARY ENTRY POINT** that:
1. **Scans your music library** and extracts metadata
2. **Queries multiple music APIs** (Spotify, MusicBrainz, Deezer) 
3. **Intelligently aggregates genres** with confidence-based weighting
4. **Updates file tags** with standardized, high-quality genre information
5. **Provides complete CLI interface** with analyze, batch, review, and test commands

### Quick Start:
```bash
# PRIMARY ENTRY POINT - Consolidated batch processor with CLI
python3 batch_processor.py /Volumes/T7/Albums batch --confidence 95

# Analyze your library
python3 batch_processor.py /Volumes/T7/Albums analyze --detailed

# Process specific album
python3 batch_processor.py /Volumes/T7/Albums batch --specific-album "100 gecs,10,000 gecs"

# WEB INTERFACE - Start the music dashboard
python3 music_dashboard.py
```

The system now uses a **single consolidated entry point** with integrated CLI and batch processing for maximum simplicity.

## System Overview

This is a **sophisticated, enterprise-grade music library management system** designed to automatically analyze and categorize music collections with accurate, standardized genre tags. The system goes far beyond basic genre tagging to provide a complete solution for music metadata management, quality control, and library organization.

**Core Process**: Scans music library ‚Üí Fetches genre data from multiple APIs ‚Üí Intelligently assigns standardized genres ‚Üí Safely updates file tags

### Simplified Architecture 

The system follows **clean separation of concerns** with two distinct entry points:

1. **CLI + Processing**: `batch_processor.py` - Consolidated command-line interface and batch processing engine
2. **Web Interface**: `music_dashboard.py` - Pure web-based management interface 

Each component has a clear single responsibility with no functional overlap.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULE

**ALWAYS RESTART THE WEB SERVER AFTER ANY CHANGES**
- Template changes (*.html files)
- Python code changes (*.py files)  
- Configuration changes
- ANY modification to the system

**Required Steps:**
1. Kill existing web server process
2. Restart with `python3 music_dashboard.py`
3. Test the changes work

**NO EXCEPTIONS** - The web server MUST be restarted after every change.

### Primary Entry Points

#### 1. Main Entry Point - Hybrid Batch Processor
```bash
# PRIMARY ENTRY POINT - Enterprise-grade batch processing with multi-source APIs
python3 batch_processor.py /Volumes/T7/Albums batch --confidence-threshold 95

# This script:
# - Automatically cleans up any rogue processes first
# - Scans your entire music library for audio files
# - Queries multiple music APIs (Spotify, MusicBrainz, Last.fm, Discogs, Deezer)
# - Uses intelligent genre aggregation with confidence scoring
# - Applies standardized genres with safety controls
# - Tracks progress in SQLite database
# - Provides detailed statistics and results
```

#### 2. Advanced CLI Application (For API-based tagging)
```bash
# Advanced command structure for API-based genre fetching
python3 batch_processor.py [MUSIC_PATH] [COMMAND] [OPTIONS]

# Available commands:
analyze  - Analyze music library with detailed statistics
batch    - Run batch processing with confidence thresholds
review   - Manual review interface for uncertain matches
test     - Run system tests and validation

# Note: This uses APIs (Spotify, MusicBrainz, etc.) to fetch genres
```

#### 3. Library Analysis Tool
```bash
# Analyze your library to see potential API match rates
python3 library_match_scanner.py

# This helps you understand how many albums will get genre matches from APIs
```

### Recommended Workflows

#### 1. Initial Library Analysis
```bash
# Basic library analysis
python3 batch_processor.py /Volumes/T7/Albums analyze

# Comprehensive analysis with quality control
python3 batch_processor.py /Volumes/T7/Albums analyze --detailed --quality

# Performance testing with limited scope
python3 batch_processor.py /Volumes/T7/Albums analyze --limit 50
```

#### 2. Production Batch Processing

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Multi-Source API Integration

The system queries multiple music databases with intelligent weighting:

- **Spotify**: Primary source with professional curation (weight: 1.0)
- **MusicBrainz**: Community-driven with high quality (weight: 0.85)
- **Discogs**: Detailed styles and rare releases (weight: 0.8)
- **Deezer**: European coverage (weight: 0.75)
- **Last.fm**: Community tags (weight: 0.7)

### Confidence Thresholds & Processing Logic

- **‚â•95%**: Automatic updates (high confidence)
- **80-94%**: Manual review queue (medium confidence)
- **<80%**: Requires manual intervention (low confidence)

### Genre Format & Standardization

- **Multi-genre format**: "Rock; Alternative; Indie Rock"
- **Hierarchical expansion**: "Death Metal" ‚Üí automatically includes "Metal"
- **Standardization examples**: "Hip-Hop" ‚Üí "Hip Hop", "R&B" ‚Üí "Rhythm and Blues"
- **200+ mapping rules** covering common variations and aliases

### Enterprise Safety Features

- **File modification safety** - Scanning operations (`music_dashboard.py`, `album_matcher.py`) NEVER modify source audio files - only read metadata. File modification is exclusively for tagging operations in separate modules (`tag_writer.py`)
- **Dry run mode** for all operations (test without changes)
- **Comprehensive validation** with detailed error checking
- **Safe tag writing** with file integrity verification
- **Rate limiting** respecting API quotas (50/min MusicBrainz, 300/min Last.fm)
